Mortality rates of Natural disasters have significantly declined over the years from millions of deaths to an average of 60,000 per year. Different natural disasters often include different types of events such as starvation, malnutrition, fire outbreak, medical emergencies, infrastructure damage. These events share a commonality in that they all impact society in a negative way. With the rise of technology and contingency practices, the designated stakeholders responsible at maintaining the outcomes of a natural disaster have manage to limit the significant impact. Despite leveraging advanced data science techniques such as Machine Learning, Deep learning, and Natural Language Processing (NLP), the stakeholders of Natural disasters are unable to consistently reduce the cost accumulated as a result, with year-on-year changes and fluctuations. (See appendix 1) The main problem faced by majority of the stakeholders surrounds the severity assessment of events from a natural disaster. There are two major issues facing severity assessment of natural disaster: Firstly, there is no gold standard universal scale that can assess different types of events equally; secondly, the overlap between events and stakeholders makes it difficult to associate disaster events to a particular stakeholder.
